# covid-malnutrition

Developed an exploratory data analysis to see if we can figure out whether there's a correlation between covid-19 virus and both malnutrion and gdp of coutries of the world.
In order to achieve our goal we will be analysing and exploring some datasets about Covid-19, malnutrition and gdp.
We have divided the work into phases as follows:
Data loading and cleaning, done by all the participants to better understand all the data at hand
Data combining and reshaping, done individually by all the participants before developing the answers
Data analysis and visualization, this is the phase in which we studied our datasets in order to answer the research questions. We decided to propose 3 of them by doing them one each.
